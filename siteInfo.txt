/**
* Other Details
**/
The PHP MVC Framework was built by me.
Scroll_Paginate JQuery Plugin was built by me, used for ajax scroll based pagination...

For Front End, the pagination works by scrolling for more content (Like Facebook).
In the backend (Admin Panel), it has pagination buttons to navigate through pages.
Backend Pagination/Sorting/Deleting/Filtering are Ajax.
